# BSRT7/5 Cell Culture


### Thawing protocol

See [generic cell thawing protocol]() [pending]

### Subculturing (splitting) protocol

1. Prepare hood for culture.  Preward growth medium and trypsin in 37C water bath.
2. Aspirate old medium from dish using sterilize aspiration pump.
3. Rinse cells in 1x PBS (without Ca or Mg): appropriate volume will vary based on culture dish size: for a 10 cm dish, use 4-5 mL.
4. Aspirate PBS.
5. Add pre-warmed trypsin/EDTA to plate (2 mL for a 10 cm dish).  Swirl to cover cells.  Return cells to incubator.
6. Monitor cells for detachment: should take ~3-5 minues.
7. When cells are mostly detached, respsupend cells and trypsin in cGMEM (~10 mL total volume for a 10 cm dish).  Mix cells by pipetting up and down gently.
8. Return appropriate volume to dish for ongoing culture (for a 1:10 split, return 1 mL from 10 mL to dish).  Discard remaining volume or use for something else (counting/plating, freezing, etc.).

### Freezing protocol

1. Prepare freezing medium and store at 4°C until use. 
2. Aspirate medium from cell culture dishes
3. Gently rinse cells in PBS and aspriate PBS.
4. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA (0.05% trypsin) to 10 cm dish (vary volume based on cell culture dish).
5. Return dish to 37˚C incubator and wait ~2-4 minutes for cells to detach.
6. Resuspend cells in cGMEM and transfer to 15 mL tube.  Leave some cells in culture if desired.
7. Spin down cells in 15 mL tube for 3 minutes at 1200 RPM.
8. While cells are spinning down, label cryovials with: 
 - Type of cells
 - The date
 - Your initials
 - The approximate # of cells in the vial: for instance: "1/2 a 10 cm [dish]"
9. Label the tops of cryovials with the type of cells, to facilitate removal from storage later.
10. After cells have spun down, aspirate supernatant and gently resuspend in freezing medium by pipeting (1 mL per cryovial).
11. Dispense aliquots of the cell suspension into cryovial.  As you aliquot them, occasionally gently mix the cells to maintain a homogeneous cell suspension.
12. Place the cells in a room temperature Mr. Frosty controlled rate freezing apparatus and place this in the -80C freezer overnight (or for up to several days).
13. Transfer cryotivals to liquid nitrogen dewar, and store them in the gas phase above the liquid nitrogen.  Be sure to close the dewar's lid!


## Medium recipes

### complete GMEM (cGMEM) Recipe

We received these cells from Klaus Conzelmann in August 2018.  His information for culturing these is:

> G-MEM BHK-21 (Life Technologies/ # 21710082) with
- 10 % FCS
- 0,5 % PenStrep
- 2 % MEM Amino Acids and
- 1 % Tryptose Phosphat

> We usually split the cells twice a week 1:10 and at every second passage we select for G 418 (1,0 mg / 1 ml medium/ Roche). 

### Freezing Medium

- Mix 47.5 mL cGMEM with 2.5 mL (5%) DMSO in a 50 mL tube
- Filter through 50 mL steriflip filter
- Leave in labeled tube at 4C
