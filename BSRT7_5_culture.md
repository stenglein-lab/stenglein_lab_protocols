# BSRT7/5 Cell Culture

### complete GMEM (cGMEM) Recipe

We received these cells from Klaus Conzelmann in August 2018.  His information for culturing these is:

> G-MEM BHK-21 (Life Technologies/ # 21710082) with
- 10 % FCS
- 0,5 % PenStrep
- 2 % MEM Amino Acids and
- 1 % Tryptose Phosphat

> We usually split the cells twice a week 1:10 and at every second passage we select for G 418 (1,0 mg / 1 ml medium/ Roche). 


### Freezing Medium

- Mix 47.5 mL cGMEM with 2.5 mL (5%) DMSO in a 50 mL tube
- Filter through 50 mL steriflip filter
- Leave in labeled tube at 4C

### Freezing protocol

1. Prepare freezing medium and store at 4°C until use. 
2. Aspirate medium from cell culture dishes
3. Gently rinse cells in PBS and aspriate PBS.
4. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin/EDTA (0.05% trypsin) to 10 cm dish (vary volume based on cell culture dish).
5. Return dish to 37˚C incubator and wait ~2-4 minutes for cells to detach.
6. Resuspend cells in cGMEM and transfer to 15 mL tube.  Leave some cells in culture if desired.
7. Spin down cells in 15 mL tube for 3 minutes at 1200 RPM.
8. While cells are spinning down, label cryovials with: 
 A. Type of cells
 B. The date
 C. Your initials
 D. The approximate # of cells in the vial: for instance: "1/2 a 10 cm [dish]"
9. Label the tops of cryovials with the type of cells, to facilitate removal from storage later.
10. After cells have spun down, aspirate supernatant and gently resuspend in freezing medium by pipeting (1 mL per cryovial).
11. Dispense aliquots of the cell suspension into cryovial.  As you aliquot them, occasionally gently mix the cells to maintain a homogeneous cell suspension.
12. Place the cells in a room temperature Mr. Frosty controlled rate freezing apparatus and place this in the -80C freezer overnight (or for up to several days).
13. Transfer cryotivals to liquid nitrogen dewar, and store them in the gas phase above the liquid nitrogen.  Be sure to close the dewar's lid!
