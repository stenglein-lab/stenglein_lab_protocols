# BSRT7/5 Cell Culture

We received these cells from Klaus Conzelmann in August 2018.  His information for culturing these is:

> We cultivate the cells at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 in the following medium:
> G-MEM BHK-21 (Life Technologies/ # 21710082) with
- 10 % FCS
- 0,5 % PenStrep
- 2 % MEM Amino Acids and
- 1 % Tryptose Phosphat

> We usually split the cells twice a week 1:10 and at every second passage we select for G 418 (1,0 mg / 1 ml medium/ Roche).
